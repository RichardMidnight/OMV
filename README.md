Open Media Vault on a Raspberry pi 4

As of Nov 2023

Need:
  -  Raspberry pi 4
  -  I used the Geekworm NASPi-Lite case
  -  Good 8GB mmc card
  -  HDD

Steps:
  1) Flash RaspiLite Bullseye to the 8GB card.  Use the 64GB version if you have an 8GB pi.
     - you MUST turn on ssh
     - easiest if you set the username / password and local settings
